# Python codes for dataset managing
A collection of our Python codes we use for managing our Stable Diffusion datasets.<br>
Keep in mind that the pictures might not be accurate, since these are getting updated.
# PromptsToTimesInDataset.py
Inputs a folder of .txt files that are in this format:
```
Tag1, Tag2, Tag3, Tag4
```
Outputs a single .txt file with the tags from all the files counted:
```
Tag3                        Times in dataset: 200834 (71.2%)
Tag4                        Times in dataset: 177592 (63.0%)
Tag1                        Times in dataset: 69141 (24.5%)
Tag2                        Times in dataset: 42733 (15.2%)
```

# FindTags.py
You enter a prompt and a folder with .txt files that are in this format:
```
Tag1, Tag2, Tag3, Tag4
```
And it will output counts of exact matches, close matches and tags that contain the prompt:

# PromptGenerator.py
Generates a random prompt based off of the prompt list generated by PromptsToTimesInDataset.py.<br>
Prioritizes more common prompts.<br>
Accepts a blacklist as well, that is written in this format:
```
Tag1, Tag2, Tag3, Tag4
```
